## Problem

Some specifications—such as the [federation specification](../federation-spec) and [CSDL specification](./csdl)—apply to GraphQL schema documents. They may place additional requirements on conforming documents. Such specifications may also introduce new types, directives, and other schema objects which can be used within those documents.

The [GraphQL Schema Definition Language](https://spec.graphql.org/) does not provide a way to declare that a schema document implements additional specs beyond the GraphQL SDL. Currently, this information is derived from context, or through some explicit, out-of-document paramenter provided to a spec processor. As a consequence, given only the text of an SDL document, there is no reliable way to discern what specifications—and what version of those specifications—the document conforms to.

This specification provides a solution in the form of a single new well-known directive—the `@using` directive. This directive allows spec authors, schema authors, and schema processors to come to an agreement on which specifications a schema document is using.

## Actors

```mermaid
#::[Actors who may be interested in the `@using` directive]
graph TB
  author("👩🏽‍💻 🤖  &nbsp;Author")-->schema(["📄  Schema"])
  schema-->proc("🤖 &nbsp;Processor")
  schema-->reader("👩🏽‍💻  Reader")
  proc-->output(["📄  Output Schema"])
```

- **Authors (either human or machine)** write one or more `@using` directives into schema files to declare that the schema conforms to some set of specifications
- **Machine processors** read the `@using` directives and compare them to a list of supported specs, activating the spec-mandated appropriate behaviors. Processors generally *pass through* schema elements they do not understand, although they may remove them or fail entirely, depending on the processor's needs and the spec's [listed purpose](#for).
- **Human readers** see the `@using` directives and can follow the URLs to the specification, receiving an explanation of the requirements of the specification and what new directives, types, and other schema objects are available within the document.

## `@using` within a document

The `@using` directive is applied to `schema` declarations to declare that the schema uses a particular spec. For example,

```graphql
#::[Using the `@using` directive]
schema @using(spec: "https://spec.example.com/example/v1.0") {
  query: Query
}
```

## The `@using` directive

```graphql
#::[Declaration of the `@using` directive]
directive @using(spec: String!, prefix: String)
  repeatable on SCHEMA
```

Documents **must** include a definition for the `@using` directive. The provided definition does not have to match the above definition exactly. Instead, it must be *compatible*. A conforming definition may:
- **Omit optional arguments** if they are never used in the document.
- **Introduce new directive locations**, the behavior of which is unspecified here.
- **Introduce new arguments.** New arguments **should** be prefixed, e.g. `example_feature: Bool`. The prefix **should** be the prefix of a spec referenced with this or another `@using` directive within the document.

### `spec`

A URL identifying the spec. When viewed, the URL **should** provide the content of the appropriate version of the specification in some human-readable form. In short, a human reader should be able to click the link and go to the docs for the version in use. It is not required that the *content* be machine-readable in any particular way.

<figure>
  <figcaption>
    <a name=anatomy-of-a-spec-url href=#anatomy-of-a-spec-url class=a-header>Basic anatomy of a spec URL</a>
  </figcaption>  
  <code class=anatomy>
    <span class=pink style='--depth: 2'>http://spec.example.com/a/b/c/<span>exampleSpec<aside>prefix</aside></span><aside>
      identity
    </aside></span>/<span style='--depth: 2' class=green>v1<aside>version</aside></span>
  </code>
</figure>

Spec URLs contain information about the spec's [prefix](#prefixing) and [version](#versioning), and should be generated and processed in accordance with the [requirements on the structure of spec URLs](#spec-urls).

### `prefix`

Change the prefix for schema elements from this specification.

```graphql
#::[Using the `@using` directive with a custom prefix]
schema @using(spec: "https://spec.example.com/example/v1", prefix: "eg") {
  query: Query
}

type User {
  name: String @eg_someDirective
}
```

This argument has no effect on specs which do not introduce prefixed schema elements.

## Spec URLs

Spec URLs serve two main purposes:
  - Directing human readers to documentation about the specification(s) in use.
  - Providing tools with information about the specs in use, along with enough information to select and invoke an implementation
  
Spec URLs **should** be [RFC 3986 URLs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). When viewed, the URL **should** provide the content of the selected version of the specification in some human-readable form; a human reader should be able to click the link and go to the correct version of the docs.

Although they are not prohibited from doing so, it's assumed that processors will not load the content of spec URLs. Published specifications are not required to be machine-readable, and [this spec](.) places no requirements on the structure or syntax of the content to be found there.

There are, however, requirements on the structure of the URL itself:

<figure>
  <figcaption>
    <a name=basic-anatomy-of-a-spec-url href=#basic-anatomy-of-a-spec-url class=a-header>Basic anatomy of a spec URL</a>
  </figcaption>  
  <code class=anatomy>
    <span class=pink style='--depth: 2'>https://spec.example.com/a/b/c/<span>exampleSpec<aside>prefix</aside></span><aside>
      identity
    </aside></span>/<span style='--depth: 2' class=green>v1.0<aside>version</aside></span>
  </code>
</figure>

The final two segments of the URL's [path](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3) **should** contain the spec's [default prefix](#prefix) and a [version specifier](#semver-specifier). The content of the URL up to and including the prefix—but excluding the version specifier and trailing `/`—is the spec's *identity*. For the above example,
<dl>
  <dt markdown>`identity: "https://spec.example.com/a/b/c/exampleSpec"`</dt>
  <dd>A global identifier for the spec. Processors can treat this as an opaque string identifying the spec (but not the version of the spec) for purposes of selecting an appropriate implementation.</dd>
  <dt markdown>`prefix: "exampleSpec"`</dt>
  <dd markdown>The spec's default prefix for purposes of [prefixing](#prefixing) schema elements it defines or extends. URLs for specs which do not employ prefixing will still be interpreted as specifying a default prefix; the default prefix will simply have no effect on implementation behavior.</dd>
  <dt markdown>`version: "v1.0"`</dt>
  <dd markdown>The [version](#versioning) of the spec against which the document was authored. Processors **must** select an implementation of the spec which is [compatible](#compatibility) with the specified version.</dd>
</dl>

### Ignore meaningless URL components

When extracting the URL's `prefix` and `version`, processors **must** ignore any url components which are not assigned a meaning. This spec assigns meaning to the final two components of the [path](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3). Other URL components—particularly query strings and fragments, if present—**must** be ignored for the purposes of extracting the `prefix` and `version`.

<figure>
  <figcaption>
    <a name=spec-url-ignore-meaningless href=#spec-url-ignore-meaningless class=a-header>Ignoring meaningless parts of a URL</a>
  </figcaption>  
  <code class=anatomy>
    <span class=pink style='--depth: 2'>https://example.com/<span>exampleSpec<aside>prefix</aside></span><aside>
      identity
    </aside></span>/<span style='--depth: 2' class=green>v1.0<aside>version</aside></span><span class=grey>?key=val&k2=v2#fragment<aside>ignored</aside></span>
  </code>
</figure>

## Prefixing
Specifications intending to be referenced via `@using` **should** prefix any schema elements they introduce. The prefix **must** be a string of characters valid within GraphQL typenames, with the exception of `"_"`.

Specs **should** define any new schema elements with names that start with `prefix_`.

```graphql
#::[Using the `@using` directive with a default prefix]
schema @using(spec: "https://spec.example.com/example/v1") {
  query: Query
}

type User {
  name: String @example_someDirective
               # prefixed directive from the example spec
}
```

The language of the spec **should** specify the default prefix and **should** identify locations where the prefix is used. The prefix **should not** be elided within documentation; definitions of schema elements provided within the spec **must** include the default prefix.

### Types

Specs which introduce new types **should** attach a prefix to those types.




Processors **should** otherwise treat the spec's identity as an opaque string identifying the specification.

This spec assigns no meaning to additional URL components, such as the query string or fragment. Processors **should** ignore any meaningless URL components when parsing the identity and semver specifier.

## Requiring `@using` within a spec

Specifications **may** include the following language to instruct schema authors to use `@using` to indicate documents which are intended to conform to the specification:

> SPEC_NAME schema documents **must**/**should**/**may** have a `schema` declaration with a [`@using` directive](/using/drafts/pre-0)
> and the specification URL `SPEC_URL`:
>
> ```graphql
> schema @using(spec: SPEC_URL) {
>   query: Query
> }
> ```

`SPEC_NAME` and `SPEC_URL` should be replaced with the names and URLs for the specification. For example:

> Example Spec schema documents **must** have a `schema` declaration with a [`@using` directive](/using/drafts/pre-0)
> and the specification URL `https://specs.example.com/example/v1`:
>
> ```graphql
> schema @using(spec: "https://specs.example.com/example/v1") {
>   query: Query
> }
> ```

## Processing Schemas

```mermaid
#::[Example processing pipeline]
graph LR
  schema(["📄  Input Schema"]):::file-->proc("🤖 &nbsp;Processor")
  proc-->output(["📄  Output Schema"]):::file
  classDef file fill:none,color:#eee;
  style proc fill:none,stroke:fuchsia,color:fuchsia;
```

A common case is that of a processor which consumes an input schema and generates an output schema.

The general guidance for processor behavior is: don't react to what you don't understand.

Specifically, processors:
  - **should** pass through `@using` directives which reference unknown spec URLs
  - **should** pass through unknown directives, types, and other schema elements
  - **should** ignore meaningless URL components (such as unknown query parameters or fragments) within `@using` URLs

An exception to this is processors which prepare the schema for final public consumption. Such processors **may** choose to eliminate all unknown directives and prefixed types in order to hide schema implementation details within the published schema. This will impair the operation of tooling which relies on these directives—such tools will not be able to run on the output schema, so the benefits and costs of this kind of information hiding should be weighed carefully on a case-by-case basis.


```graphql
#::[`@using` directive with a query string]
schema
  @using(spec: "https://spec.example.com/example/v1?unrelated=value")
  { ... }
```

This directive:
- Declares that the document conforms to a spec which can be found at `https://spec.example.com/example/v1`
- Has a identity of `https://spec.example.com/example`, identifying the specification
- Has a [semver specifier](#semver-specifier) of `v1` identifying the spec version
- Has a query string of `"unrelated=value":
  - This has no effect unless `example` assigns it specific meaning.

## Semantic Versioning

Specifications **should** provide a semantic version number.

### SemVer Specifiers

The final `/`-separated path component **must** be a semver specifier. Semver specifiers take the form `v*major*.*minor*.*patch*-*prerelease*`. The minor, patch, and pre-release specifiers are all optional. Examples:

```
#::[Valid SemVer specifiers]
v1
v1.2
v1.2.3-alpha
v2.2.3-alpha.2
```

### SemVer selection

Processors **should** select the highest available spec implementation which is compatible with the requested version according to the [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) rules for version compatibility. For example, consider this directive:

```graphql
#::[`@using` version 2.x.y]
schema @using(spec: "https://specs.example.com/example/v2")
```

Upon seeing this directive, processors which support the `https://specs.example.com/example` spec **should** activate a version of their implementation which is compatible with major version 2.

```graphql
#::[`@using` version 3.1.1-alpha]
schema @using(spec: "https://specs.example.com/example/v3.1.1-alpha")
```

This selects versions in the `3.1.1-alpha` prerelease series. For example, a processor may satisfy this requirement by activating version `3.1.1-alpha.2` of `example`.

### Why is versioning in the URL, not a directive argument?

The version is in the URL because when a human reader visits the URL, we would like them to be taken to the documentation for the *version of the specification in use by this document*. Putting the version information in a separate argument to the `@using` directive would prevent this.

### Backus-Naur Form for SemVer specifier

```text
#::[BNF grammar for SemVer specifiers]
‹valid specifier› ::= "v" ‹partial semver›
‹partial semver› ::= ‹major›
                   | ‹major› "." ‹minor›
                   | ‹major› "." ‹minor› "." ‹patch›
                   | ‹major› "." ‹minor› "." ‹patch› "-" ‹pre-release›
```

`major`, `minor`, `patch` and `pre-release` are defined in [the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 spec](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
